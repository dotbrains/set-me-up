# Open new terminal window from the command line using v3 syntax for applescript as needed in terminal Version 3+

# Usage:
#     terminal                   Opens the current directory in a new terminal window
#     terminal [PATH]            Open PATH in a new terminal window
#     terminal [CMD]             Open a new terminal window and execute CMD
#     terminal [PATH] [CMD]      Opens a new terminal window @ the PATH and executes CMD
#
# Example:
#     terminal ~/Code/HelloWorld ./setup.sh
